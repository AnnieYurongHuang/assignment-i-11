# Airline Reviews Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on loading and analyzing an airline reviews dataset to extract key insights using Python in both VS Code and Google Colab. The analysis includes calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as generating exploratory data visualizations. Additionally, the project compares the workflow experience between using VS Code and Google Colab for data analysis tasks.

## Contents
- Loading and exploring a CSV dataset
- Data cleaning and processing
- Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation)
- Generating exploratory visualizations (e.g., boxplots)
- Comparing VS Code and Google Colab for data analysis

## Files
- `analyze_airline_data.py`: Python script for loading and analyzing the dataset in VS Code.
- `AirlineReviews.csv`: The CSV file containing the airline reviews data.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## Summary of Steps
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Display the first few rows to understand the data structure.

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for relevant columns such as `OverallRating`, `SeatComfort`, `CabinStaffService`, etc.
- Print these statistics for initial insights into the data.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Generate a boxplot using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore the distribution of review scores across different categories.
